# Bayesian_exploration_suicidal_rates

Suicide is a tragic event with strong emotional repercussions for survivors and for families of its
victims. It is a major public health problem and a leading cause of death around the globe. Many
organizations such as United Nations Development Program, World Bank, World Health
Organization are making various effort to prevent suicide from people’s last minute decisions as
well as from the root causes. These organizations also collect data to help researchers study
potential variables that contribute to people’s suicide rates. Our project looks at the suicide data
compiled by these organizations and aims to identify and alleviate causes that contribute to
suicide rates across the population.
